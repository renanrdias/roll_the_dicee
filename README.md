# dice_project

## The main goal

The main goal of the project is to apply core programming concepts. This app will provide some basic functionality by using setState() inside Stateful Widgets.

## The App

This app will simulate two dices that when pressed, they show us random number from 1 to 6 in their visible faces.

## The main topics learned
* Use Stateless Widgets to build the UI.
* Use Stateful Widgets in order to update the UI.
* Change properties of Widgets
* Understand how the event onPressed works when a button is pressed.
* Understand how setState works to mark the widget tree dirty, and therefore updates the UI on the next render.
* Check out the Expanded Widget to build UI that adapts in certain way to the screen size of the user's device.
* Use string interpolation.
* Use basic concepts in Dart such as data types and functions.
* Code and use Gesture Controls.
